    "<li>Code modularity - in general, breaking up large tasks into reusable pieces of code will be preferable. If/when you add to this later on, it'll be much easier. \n",
    "<li>Commenting - we'll comment this code in the correct manner. See the example for a pattern that should be enough to follow. Commenting is dull and boring, but generally very important; we leave it mainly to the coding class to cover proper comments, but we'll do it the 'proper' way here since we are creating a portable tool.

    "When creating this EDA class, place it in a regular python file, e.g. ml_utils.py. The python file is effectively just one big code cell and pretty much everything that you write should translate directly (there's a slight possibility you might need to adjust somehting, my sample worked as is. If so, Google the error, it is probably common, then ask me if you don't get it). This utility file can also stay with you and be built upon as we go forward; any common code that you use repeatedly can be built into a function in this file, then you can just import it (like thinkstats2 and thinkplot) to your notebook, and use those things without rewriting them. \n",

    "This approach is really common, when programming we want to make things into reusable functions almost as often as possible. It saves us work, allows us to not have to think about the same challenge repeatedly, makes it easy to make improvements, and reduces the probablity of making an error. As we go, add to it! \n",
